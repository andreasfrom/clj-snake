# clj-snake

A simple Snake-game I wrote to improve my skills with Clojure and functional programming.

The code could probably be much conciser, but as my first project it pleases me.

## Usage

Arrow keys to move.

`lein run` to start or download my [uberjar from Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/50utpfwzpwpvswi/clj-snake.jar).

## Thanks
Steve Losh for his [clojure-lanterna](http://sjl.bitbucket.org/clojure-lanterna/) library.

## Todo
* Handle eating the apple better. Atm. it's an atom...
